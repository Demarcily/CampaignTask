      <p>
        Ever since Covid-19 came there has been an absurd amount of disinformation and conspiracy theories spreading around, 
        theories that are extremely dangerous because of their tendency to target minorities, ignore scientific evidence and 
        twist words to fit their narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of this disinformation and conspiracy theories which can deal great harm to a large amount of people we 
        decided to try and do something about it, what we are planning on doing is to actively debunk any kind of 
        conspiracy theory related to Covid-19 that pops up while also correcting any form of disinformation that might occur.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will do our best to spread facts about Covid-19 around social media such as YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, etc. 
        And we hope that you will aid us in our goal by further spreading our messages or using the sources we provide to 
        battle disinformation.
